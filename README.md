## **Description**

Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions (e.g., hand washing with soap and the use of clean water) are promoted to prevent and control transmission pahtyways of diarrheal disease-causing pathogens.

This project provides agent-based models (ABMs) of WASH interventions. In the model, individual human interacts each other in the community.  

## **Model Objectives**

This model has been developed to perform Monte Carlo Simulation and sensitivity analysis. 
The simulations are executed by varying four input parameters embedded in the model 
(i.e., the proportion of households with a Drinking Water intervention, a Sanitation interventation, and a Hand Washing Intervention).

* The proportion of households with a Driking Water intervention: U = [0.1 to 1.0 with increments of 0.1 with equal probability of selection]
* The proportion of households with a Sanitation intervention: U = [0.1 to 1.0 with increments of 0.1 with equal proability of selection]
* The proportion of households with a Hand Washing intervention: U = [0.1 to 1.0 with increments of 0.1 with equal probability of selection]

## **Instruction**

In order to run this model, [AnyLogic](https://www.anylogic.com/downloads/) simulation software should be installed in your local environment. 

"Personal Learning Edition (PLE)" limits creating a large number of dynamic agents (i.e., 50,000). 

For this project, you may be able to ran the model through "PLE" version. 

For the proper use of this model, please purchase "University Researcher version" or try free 60-day trial. 

If you have any concerns and questions, please contact me (jeonyoung.kang.geo@gmail.com).
